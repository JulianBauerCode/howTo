Add path to application to global path
i.e. Enable running application from everywhere 

to enable execution of all executable files in directory $HOME/abaqus/Commands, 
this directory has to be added to systemvariable $PATH.
To do so, modify file .bashrc which is located in home directory
cd ~
gedit .bashrc
and add

if [ -d "$HOME/abaqus/Commands" ] ; then
    PATH="$HOME/abaqus/Commands:$PATH"
fi

to this file. if directory "$HOME/abaqus/Commands" exists, $PATH will be extended by "$HOME/abaqus/Commands".
Changes in .bashrc will be usable after execution of
source .bashrc
and variable $PATH can be displayed by
echo $PATH

Installiere eclipse mit pydev(Entwicklungsumgebung Python) und egit(Git-Implementierung fuer Eclipse)
unter Ubuntu 16.04 aus Paketquellen.

Anmerkung: Wird eclipse aus den offiziellen Paketquellen unter Ubuntu 16.04 installiert, dann ist die Versionsnummer 3.8.1 (Nachzuschauen nach Installation von Eclipse unter : HELP > About Eclipse Platform).
Die aktuellsten Versionen von pydev und egit sind nicht kompatibel mit der Eclipseversion 3.8.1.
Bei Verwendung von Eclipse 3.8.1 mit pydev und egit sind deshalb entsprechend alte, unterstuetzte Versionen von pydev und egit zu installieren.
